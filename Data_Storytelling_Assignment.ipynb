    "The story needs to have a beginning, middle and end. Technical and nontechnical elements must be woven into the storyline in ways that are clear to the audience. Discussing data-based facts isn't exciting, but a memorable story is. Take the basic information, and weave it into a story that is understandable, is believable and delivers the right message.\n",
    "</p><p><b><u>\n",
    "3. Use language your audience understands:-</u></b>\n",
    "If the audience is technical, it's OK to use technical terms and jargon. By contrast, an audience of senior managers might respond better to nontechnical terms aligned with their interest and expertise. For this audience, use business-related terms, and avoid tech jargon.</p>\n",
    "<p><b><u>\n",
    "4. Base your story in the real world:-</u></b>\n",
    "Create a story that's real and, when possible, is based on real-world events. If the story is hypothetical, be sure the audience understands that. This is where a visual storytelling tool, such as Shorthand, can be helpful.</p>\n",

    "5. Gauge audience response and sum up:-</u></b>\n",
